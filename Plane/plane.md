✈️ Plane - My First PCB Design
Plane is my first custom PCB project, designed to simulate the lighting effect found on airplane wings. This simple circuit includes resistors, capacitors, and LEDs arranged to visually mimic wingtip lights, often used for orientation and safety on real aircraft.

Power multiple LEDs representing plane wing lights

Include basic passive components for voltage control and stability

Be compact and simple enough for beginners to fabricate and solder

The lights can be statically on or modified later with microcontroller logic to blink in patterns.

📐 Design Notes
Designed using [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/)

All traces are routed for minimal interference

The layout resembles a small aircraft outline, with LEDs placed at the ends to simulate left and right wings
